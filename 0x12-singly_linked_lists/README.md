# 0x13. C - 0x12. C - Singly linked lists

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etc… is forbidden
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`
- You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
- In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `lists.h`
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded


## Betty linter
To run the Betty linter just with command `betty <filename>`:
- Go to the [Betty](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/wQ4sMfsWfxvyfN67Sc11zA) repository
- Clone the [repo](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/wQ4sMfsWfxvyfN67Sc11zA) to your local machine
- `cd` into the Betty directory
- Install the linter with `sudo ./install.sh`
- `emacs` or `vi` a new file called `betty`, and copy the script below:
```
  #!/bin/bash
  # Simply a wrapper script to keep you from having to use betty-style
  # and betty-doc separately on every item.
  # Originally by Tim Britton (@wintermanc3r), multiargument added by
  # Larry Madeo (@hillmonkey)
  
  BIN_PATH="/usr/local/bin"
  BETTY_STYLE="betty-style"
  BETTY_DOC="betty-doc"
  
  if [ "$#" = "0" ]; then
    echo "No arguments passed."
    exit 1
  fi
  
  for argument in "$@" ; do
    echo -e "\n========== $argument =========="
    ${BIN_PATH}/${BETTY_STYLE} "$argument"
    ${BIN_PATH}/${BETTY_DOC} "$argument"
  done
```
- Once saved, exit file and change permissions to apply to all users with `chmod a+x betty`
- Move the `betty` file into `/bin/` directory or somewhere else in your `$PATH` with `sudo mv betty /bin/`
You can now type `betty <filename>` to run the Betty linter!


## More Info
Please use this data structure for this project:
```
/**
 * struct list_s - singly linked list
 * @str: string - (malloc'ed string)
 * @len: length of the string
 * @next: points to the next node
 *
 * Description: singly linked list node structure
 */
typedef struct list_s
{
    char *str;
    unsigned int len;
    struct list_s *next;
} list_t;
```

# Tasks
### 0. Print list
Write a function that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list.
- Prototype: size_t `print_list(const list_t *h);`
- Return: the number of nodes
- Format: see example
- If `str` is `NULL`, print `[0] (nil)`
- You are allowed to use `printf`
- File: `0-print_list.c`


### 1. List length
Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked `list_t` list.
- Prototype: `size_t list_len(const list_t *h);`
- File: `1-list_len.c`

### 2. Add node
Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list.
- Prototype: `list_t *add_node(list_t **head, const char *str);`
- Return: the address of the new element, or `NULL` if it failed
- `str` needs to be duplicated
- You are allowed to use `strdup`
- File: `2-add_node.c`


### 3. Add node at the end
Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list.
- Prototype: `list_t *add_node_end(list_t **head, const char *str);`
- Return: the address of the new element, or `NULL` if it failed
- `str` needs to be duplicated
- You are allowed to use `strdup`
- File: `3-add_node_end.c`


### 4. Free list
Write a function that frees a `list_t` list.
- Prototype: `void free_list(list_t *head);`
- File: `4-free_list.c`


### 5. The Hare and the Tortoise
Write a function that prints `You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n` before the `main` function is executed.
- You are allowed to use the `printf` function
- File: `100-first.c`


### 6. Real programmers can write assembly code in any language
Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints `Hello, Holberton,` followed by a new line.
- You are only allowed to use the `printf` function
- You are not allowed to use interrupts
- Your program will be compiled using `nasm` and `gcc`:
```
julien@ubuntu:~/$ nasm -f elf64 101-hello_holberton.asm && gcc -no-pie -std=gnu89 101-hello_holberton.o -o hello
julien@ubuntu:~/$ ./hello 
Hello, Holberton
julien@ubuntu:~/$ 
```
- File: `101-hello_holberton.asm`
